Nor am I a successful entrepreneur, having a strong preference to put my time and efforts into technologically interesting directions, often disregarding their financial viability. In short, I am better at building stuff, rather than planning on how whatever it is I&#x2019;ve created is used to generate revenue and turned into a successful enterprise.</span></p><p style><span style>With that said, being familiar with the reality of deliveries from the ground up, and having explored the possibilities of the </span><span style><a href="https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution" style>Telegram Bot Platform</a></span><span style>, I dare say that there is still a problem in this domain that can be solved systematically and fundamentally. Read on to find out how. </span></p><h5 id="h.1f06rqk4lr67" style><span style>I&#x2019;ve taken interest in micrologistics for over a decade.</span></h5><p style><span style>My passion for cycling, combined with an urban lifestyle, kept bringing my attention to this field. Back in 2009 I have built greenie.co.il, a naive (&amp; now-defunct) attempt at getting clients, businesses &amp; couriers to independently collaborate over logistics, by enabling discovery (based on geography &amp; time availability) and communication. It </span><span style><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=149603047019&amp;set=gm.10151279920055317" style>did gain</a></span><span style>&#xA0;</span><span style><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=149603047019&amp;set=gm.10151279920055317" style>some attention</a></span><span style>, but was too unspecialized to compete with then-established players like 10Bis in the israeli scene. Plus, the world wasn&#x2019;t ready - smartphones became common only a couple years later. The (now ancient) </span><span style><a href="https://github.com/guyromm/greencouriers" style>source code&#x2019;s still there</a></span><span style>..</span></p><p style><span style>More recently, during the 2020 lockdowns, I kept myself in shape by working as a Wolt partner courier. A year or two prior, Wolt took the Israeli food delivery scene by storm. Working with them, as well as following the news, helped me reach some insights regarding how they pulled it off.</span></p><h4 id="h.rhxqnn4ciij4" style><span style>Wolt in Israel, who&#x2019;s benefiting</span></h4><p style><span style>Ever since Wolt took the Israeli stage by storm, I, a Tel-Aviv based customer, have enjoyed a strong decrease in delivery times and a manyfold increase in selection. They&#x2019;ve really levelled the playing field.</span></p><p style><span style>As an occasional courier my experience was also positive. On busy evenings I&#x2019;d have my orders lined up and their order of execution made logistic sense. The payment was above market average for food deliveries, though that&#x2019;s just what I hear, no first-hand experience elsewhere to make comparisons. </span></p><h5 id="h.jtevto80n2ux" style><span style>So who&#x2019;s gotten the short end of the blanket? </span></h5><p style><span style>The businesses. Wolt, having positioned itself as the main go-to channel for eaters to order online, are in a position to pressure businesses into fees that hover around 30% for every order. And the restaurants </span><span style><a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001354018" style>aren&#x2019;t happy</a></span><span style>. Let&#x2019;s call them </span><span style>providers</span><span style>&#xA0;from hereon.</span></p><h4 id="h.1tzcqcminhsl" style><span style>Wolt&#x2019;s secret sauce - what they&#x2019;re doing right</span></h4><p style><span style>Customer satisfaction, I am told, is the thing that&#x2019;s hardest to achieve and sustain in the food business. So, behind Wolt&#x2019;s promise of 30-40 minute delivery times there is a well-oiled support team that quickly responds to maintain quality of service for customers, resolves edge cases, and takes care of customer compensation, if all else fails.</span></p><p style><span style>In essence, Wolt took the biggest market segment (restaurant deliveries), which happens to also be the one with the lowest margins, and having taken over the market, increased those margins to its benefit, at the provider&#x2019;s expense.</span></p><h4 id="h.pfzvxj9ylcn0" style><span style>So what doesn&#x2019;t Wolt do?</span></h4><p style><span style>Here&#x2019;s a bunch of aspects I&#x2019;ve identified that Wolt doesn&#x2019;t cover. </span></p><h5 id="h.j9kkkh6li5ns" style><span style>Accept cash</span></h5><p style><span style>Being the order taker for your client is obviously the most straightforward way of enjoying a slice of the pie, but by no means the only.</span></p><p style><span style>So long as a standing interest to cooperate exists (the provider, courier want to secure an incoming stream of orders), the facilitator (platform), and any party that willingly participates in achieving this goal will be rewarded. </span></p><h5 id="h.e4hxx3anof43" style><span style>Cluster customers &amp; providers by geography</span></h5><p style><span style>It&#x2019;s true that Wolt courier fees depend on the distance for the courier to travel. However, their current policy includes a minimum fee per order, regardless of how short the run is.</span></p><p style><span style>Several high-profile neighborhoods in Tel-Aviv have clusters of establishments (providers) whose interest is to build a customer base with an emphasis on the community. Ordering from close-by results in shorter delivery times, increases the volume of orders and can reduce shipping costs. This opportunity is completely missed, as of now.</span></p><h5 id="h.vm8c6wkaw6nr" style><span style>Appeal to verticals which aren&#x2019;t food orders</span></h5><p style><span style>There is competition springing up for delicatessen and even groceries. But what I think is the biggest issue here is that the identification of such verticals comes not from the interested parties (consumers, providers) but from outside entrepreneurs. It could very well be that much more can be accomplished with a micrologistics infrastructure than it is realized, if only initiative came from those who are closer to the sources of supply &amp; demand. </span></p><h5 id="h.nurbms93d57k" style><span style>Next-day and other optimizations</span></h5><p style><span style>Wolt currently optimizes by clustering orders whose providers and clients are geographically close and grouping them with a given courier remains within the time constraints of the courier.</span></p><p style><span style>However, many more &#x201C;long tail&#x201D; scenarios exist, such as next-day deliveries.</span></p><h5 id="h.w5ouwipq3sqv" style><span style>Delegate responsibility</span></h5><p style><span style>That&#x2019;s the biggest one, and what I believe is the key to creating something fundamentally better. Wolt&#x2019;s structure considers three roles, while Wolt itself fulfills a fourth. The three roles are customers, couriers and providers (=restaurants, in Wolt&#x2019;s case). Wolt fulfills a fourth role (let&#x2019;s call it the </span><span style>operator </span><span style>role)</span><span style>, of being the responsibility, payment and logistics guarantor for mutually beneficial cooperation between the first three kinds of parties.</span></p><p style><span style>Because Wolt specializes on a particular vertical (food) on a fixed scale (city-wide) it is not geared to expand and act on different kinds of opportunities (such as the several examples provided above).</span></p><p style><span style></span></p><h4 id="h.kxvb60fdhie2" style><span style>How to tackle competing with Wolt operationally</span></h4><h5 id="h.tu7sylou15an" style><span style>Allow partner operators to make use of the platform/service and establish themselves independently</span></h5><p style><span style>That&#x2019;s the most important bit. A partner on the ground will have an intimate knowledge of how to reach his customers, what to offer them, what problems they need to be solving, how to manage pricing competitively.</span></p><h5 id="h.gxkc7ej3ncun" style><span style>Currently, would-be competitors to Wolt are unable to enter the market because of barriers</span></h5><p style><span style>It&#x2019;s too hard to develop your own app. Solving micrologistics is hard. Going through app-store reviews is hard.</span></p><p style><span style>So, instead of building their own platform, they need to be given an opportunity to </span><span style>use an existing</span><span style>&#xA0;</span><span style>platform as a service</span><span style>.</span></p><p style><span style>In order to differentiate their brand, they can still set up their own website/domain, and run a separate communications channel.</span></p><p style><span style>The communication channel is possible by building the solution on top of a messaging app such as Telegram, where each partner can register their own Bot.</span></p><p style><span style>Thus, they&#x2019;ll be using an established communications platform with a large existing user base, instead of bootstrapping yet another native app. </span></p><h4 id="h.aqbkm78w7ikf" style><span style>The technology to get there fast - Telegram</span></h4><ul class="lst-kix_rg20wey59o3f-0 start" style><li style><span style>Telegram has a large existing user base.</span></li><li style><span style>Telegram bots are a well-developed ecosystem that support</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_rg20wey59o3f-1 start" style><li style><span style>Elaborate menus</span></li><li style><span style>Push notifications</span></li><li style><span style>Real time location sharing (courier location)</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_rg20wey59o3f-0" style><li style><span style>Telegram bots are scalable to allow </span><span style>partner operators to each run their own bot</span><span style>&#xA0;using a platform supporting their operation.</span></li><li style><span style>Telegram bots include support for processing payments.</span></li><li style><span style>No need to get into the app store.
