They do so in the old fashioned way they always have: invite friends, gather around a table, pick a game, set up the board, deal the pieces and roll the dice.</span></p><p style><span style></span></p><p style><span style>While, since the advent of the PC, there have been been many attempts at implementing board games, both as single player (vs. computer), and multiplayer configurations (with local and remote opponents), there has not yet been a proper attempt to create a board game experience for the modern consumer landscape, which is characterized by two things: the smartphone and the smart TV.</span></p><h3 id="h.49giwbhfdviy" style><span style>Problem</span></h3><p style><span style>While the existing experience did stand the test of time and is certainly not going anywhere, some aspects of it could substantially be improved upon. Namely:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_r03eqqe1wwqg-0 start" style><li style><span style>The state of a game does not persist between sessions, unless cumbersome actions (putting the board away, putting aside player hand states) are made to preserve it. Long games cannot be resumed.</span></li><li style><span style>The availability of a given title depends on whether someone bought the physical box and its available at a time and place where that game is desired. Have you gone camping and forgot / did not have want to take a bulky box along?</span></li><li style><span style>Game modification is difficult. If only the rules are affected it&#x2019;s rather straightforward. However, if modifying game art, the board or adding new pieces is desired, the barrier is raised significantly.</span></li><li style><span style>There is no easy discovery of interested players within a user&#x2019;s social circle.</span></li></ul><p style><span style></span></p><p style><span style>And these are just the issues that end-users have. Game publishers, being tied to an archaic distribution model:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_2krd1teckhrj-0 start" style><li style><span style>Cannot release game updates &amp; corrections easily (only as expansion packs or new editions)</span></li><li style><span style>Cannot offer in-game purchases, per-player customizations, player progression beyond the initial deliverable is impossible.</span></li><li style><span style>Cannot communicate to players and fans directly, offering them relevant news &amp; updates.</span></li></ul><p style><span style></span></p><p style><span style>Thus, each popular game vendor licenses or </span><span style><a href="https://www.catan.com/game/catan-universe" style>develops their own solution</a></span><span style>, which do not offer a universal, familiar experience, nor moddability, nor the ability to play together.</span></p><h3 id="h.qzzip7pmh00" style><span style></span></h3><h3 id="h.nn5rnmsoj9az" style><span style>Enter BoardHub</span></h3><p style><span style>BoardHub is a service that&#x2019;s designed to address all of the above issues. The easiest way into its vision would be to walk the reader through the main usage scenarios</span></p><h4 id="h.kadceq3pxp4" style><span style>Game organizer</span></h4><p style><span style>You&#x2019;d like to organize a game evening with friends. You invite them by a medium of your choice and enter boardhub to set up a new game. </span></p><ol class="lst-kix_xqbjam8clps0-0 start" start="1" style><li style><span style>Open a browser on the big smart TV in the living room and head to boardhub. Authenticate by email or social media login, and proceed to choose the game to be played. </span><sup style><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1" style>[a]</a></sup></li><li style><span style>Once the game is chosen, the host configures the amount of seats and chooses various other flags and settings such as special game rules.</span></li><li style><span style>Part of the game setup process allow the host to send direct invite links by any medium to game participants. However, it&#x2019;s not mandatory. At this point, the TV displays the overall game board (shared game state) and a scannable QR code in the corner.</span></li></ol><h4 id="h.ucajv6ba2hr0" style><span style>Game participant</span></h4><ol class="lst-kix_xqbjam8clps0-0" start="4" style><li style><span style>As participants arrive, each scans the QR code to be seated at the game, optionally setting up their in-game player in the process (name, piece color and so on).</span></li><li style><span style>Once everyone has joined and have marked their state as ready, the host (through teir smartphone or desktop) begins the game.</span></li><li style><span style>Each player, in their turn, controls the game movements from their device. On their phone they can see game information that pertains to them only (what cards are held and so on).</span></li><li style><span style>The big TV displays the shared state of the game, which is usually the game board, he house cards - information that is available to everyone. Every player can switch to the &#x201C;board view&#x201D; display on their respective smartphone as well, if they are not seeing the shared state on the TV screen, or have chosen to play remotely.</span></li><li style><span style>Once the game is over, the winners are announced on the big screen, as well as to each player on their device</span></li><li style><span style>Each participant can proceed to share their result via social media, as well as access the linked social media profiles of other game participants. Pictures from the game can be created, customized with smartphone photos, uploaded to social media with all willing players tagged. This is one of the viral paths for Boardhub&#x2019;s adoptation.</span></li></ol><h4 id="h.4f57effqd0qv" style><span style>Indie game modder/developer</span></h4><p style><span style>Most games published on BoardHub are initially open source. They are hosted at github or other HTTP-accessible, publically available Git repositories, with this information being readily available to users on each game page</span></p><p style><span style>The server side implementation of those games is in a high-level Object-Oriented Python, while the client side is implemented in a high-level JS framework such as React (or maybe Elm).</span></p><p style><span style>This means that game logic, as well as its graphics are readily available for examination, modification (modding) and peer review by anyone interested.</span></p><p style><span style>A modder may fork the code of a previously published BoardHub game, work on it locally (the bare development environment for running games locally is open sourced as well) and change its rules, make corrections, enhance or replace its graphics, and submit it on BoardHub, which, following a review process, will make it available for gameplay.</span></p><p style><span style>The purpose of such openness is to facilitate the creation of an ecosystem of indie developers who would create, extend, mutate and adapt classic games for their particular tastes, cultures and express their own ideas within. That, in turn, would further contribute to a rapid adaptation of the platform by board gamers worldwide.</span></p><p style><span style></span></p><h4 id="h.pr1pya2ncgw5" style><span style>Commercial game vendor</span></h4><p style><span style>While the above use case is instrumental in positioning BoardHub as the standard platform and ecosystem for board game development and gameplay, the commercial vendor that sells their game will not be able to use it due to its free nature.</span></p><p style><span style>A commercial game vendor is interested in</span></p><ol class="lst-kix_kx2b84cjusuw-0 start" start="1" style><li style><span style>Selling their title in a modern online format, while not wasting a fortune on development</span></li><li style><span style>Being able to reach a large relevant audience of boardgamers.</span></li><li style><span style>Pushing game updates and expansion packs to existing users through a well-established channel</span></li></ol><p style><span style>Monetization of Boardhub would come from such game vendors, who are already well experienced &amp; motivated in selling their product.</span></p><p style><span style>A game vendor would be interested in publishing a game on Boardhub if </span></p><ol class="lst-kix_873581utlcog-0 start" start="1" style><li style><span style>the barrier to publishing is cheaper than going solo (porting a game is straightforward with a high quality SDK and in a high-level language).</span></li><li style><span style>The potential to reach a large gamer audience is serious.</span></li><li style><span style>There is an easy monetization process in place.</span></li></ol><p style><span style></span></p><hr style><h3 id="h.swbpq2xbqdjg" style><span style></span></h3><h3 id="h.m9eo3obhslvx" style><span style>Game types</span></h3><p style><span style>Boardhub will be focus on games having the following attributes:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_aw5a6dxomywh-0 start" style><li style><span style>Turn based</span></li><li style><span style>Having a &#x201C;house&#x201D; or a shared state (board game)</span></li><li style><span style>Involving cards, game pieces and/or dice.</span></li><li style><span style>Being multiplayer</span></li></ul><p style><span style>Examples of well known games that fit the above characteristics are:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_vi8q0gdt43su-0 start" style><li style><span style>Chess</span></li><li style><span style>Monopoly</span></li><li style><span style>Backgammon</span></li><li style><span style>Poker</span></li><li style><span style>Settlers of Catan</span></li><li style><span style>Go</span></li></ul><h3 id="h.jhy4swty2st5" style><span style>Technology</span></h3><p style><span style>Boardhub, initially, will be built using a Web-oriented technology stack, for the following reasons:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_jfmmvxaemjzi-0 start" style><li style><span style>Immediate availability on a large amount of devices / formats such as smartphone, tablet, desktop, smart TV.</span></li><li style><span style>Straightforward integration with social media platforms.</span></li><li style><span style>Single implementation and ability to build &amp; evolve the platform rapidly</span></li><li style><span style>High level game implementations that allows modders/game developers to produce results quickly.</span></li><li style><span style>Board games do not require competitive native graphics as other games do.</span></li><li style><span style>Game progress is saved as unstructured JSON objects in a PostgreSQL RDBMS.
